               <h2>Amadis in Translation</h2> 
        <p>The Castilian romance of chivalry <em>Amad&iacute;s de Gaula</em> was one of the most famous books of the sixteenth century, but today it is best known as the book that drove Cervantes's Don Quixote mad.  <em>Amad&iacute;s</em> inspired early modern translations in Italian, French, Portuguese, English, Dutch, and Hebrew. In later centuries, scholars in France and England have continued to translate the work, and each time they do so, the ideology and the politics of the text changes. The <a href="http://amadis.newtfire.org/index.html" target="_blank">Amadis in Translation</a> project uses TEI encoding to analyze the translation strategies of authors who have produced versions of Garci Rodr&iacute;guez de Montalvo&#39;s 1508 <em?Amad&iacute;s de Gaula</em> in English, French, and Italian. The project has begun with an analysis of Romantic poet Robert Southey's 1803 English translation. Southey engages in cultural translation of language and concepts from early modern Spanish, presenting the romance for an English-speaking audience steeped in Protestantism and in antiquarian notions of the Middle Ages.

        <h2>Lope de Vega Project</h2>

        <p>The Lope de Vega Project examines a selection of texts available in the public domain by early modern Spanish playwright F&eacute;lix Lope de Vega y Carpio (1562-1635). A figure comparable to Shakespeare, Lope de Vega wrote approximately 500 plays, of which 300 survive. The Lope de Vega Project identifies the co-occurrence of emotion, gender, the body, and honor in several different works. In his manifesto on theatre, <q>The New Art of Comedy,</q> Lope de Vega wrote that the purpose of a play is to evoke strong emotion in an audience of ordinary people. The Lope project tests this idea by using computer code to determine whether emotion correlates with gender, class, or age and whether the representation of emotion in Lopes plays corresponds to the humoral theories that dominated early modern Castilian medical texts. At the current time, the project team is conducting preliminary analysis on two plays in Spanish and a novel in English translation.</p></body></html>
